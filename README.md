# File-Tag-System

In this File-Tag-System we create a software that will help users organize their Files on disk using Tags.
• A tag is an arbitrary value that can be associated with a file. (Like names of people, places, events, etc.)
• Users should be able to tag their files and locate them using tags.
• A file can be associated with multiple tags, and a tag can be associated with multiple files.
• You can relate it to something like how an email-client help organize emails using labels.

ESSENTIAL FEATURES : 

The user is given the choice to tag any file he like with two option,either tag by name(in this the user will provide tags of any name they want , with execption that 
tag name cannot consist of space(' ') or hyphen('-'))or tag by color(in this user will be given the option to choose any color to tag a file).

The File-Tag relationships is stored in a file in the system and is used as storage and is also accesed by the program during execution.The file is maintained using
C/C++ command.In the program , the data is managed with the help of map and set data structure where with the help of map , we can simply link files to tags.

As the data is stored in file in user's system , it is free from any database and it forms a local txt file to store its data in the user's system itself.
